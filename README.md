# SpectralTypeLab

An extremely old-school lab, almost exactly the 1990's CLEA Classification of Stellar Spectra Lab converted to HTML.  Uses data from Jacoby et al. (1984).  

I have copied three of the spectra as appropriate and renamed them Betelgeuse, Bellatrix, and Tabit. Students can use Aladin Lite to visually inspect the colors of the stars to knit what they are learning about spectral type here into what the already know about temperature and color.

To host to students:
